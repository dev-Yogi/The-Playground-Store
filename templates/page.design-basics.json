There are ADA swings, fully accessible play structures, wheelchair merry-go-rounds, ADA accessible diggers, ADA accessible sand tables and even wheelchair swings.<\/p><h3>Q: What is ADA compliance?<\/h3><p>ADA stands for the American Disabilities Act. It accounts for simple additions like ramps at public places, crossing signs that make noise, and even handicapped bathrooms in public areas.

There are panels that teach everything from new languages to basic math concepts. A playground doesn’t have to be a brainless physical place of activity, it can be a place of learning as well.<\/p><h3>Q: Is a playground high-maintenance?<\/h3><p>Its no secret that playgrounds require regular maintenance, but the level of maintenance can vary based on the types of surfacing and equipment selected. However, no matter how low maintenance a playground is, someone on your staff should be running weekly walk-throughs to prevent injuries.<\/p>",

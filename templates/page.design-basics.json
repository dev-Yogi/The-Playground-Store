There are ADA swings, fully accessible play structures, wheelchair merry-go-rounds, ADA accessible diggers, ADA accessible sand tables and even wheelchair swings.<\/p><h3>Q: What is ADA compliance?<\/h3><p>ADA stands for the American Disabilities Act.

There are panels that teach everything from new languages to basic math concepts. A playground doesn’t have to be a brainless physical place of activity, it can be a place of learning as well.<\/p><h3>Q: Is a playground high-maintenance?<\/h3><p>Its no secret that playgrounds require regular maintenance, but the level of maintenance can vary based on the types of surfacing and equipment selected. However, no matter how low maintenance a playground is, someone on your staff should be running weekly walk-throughs to prevent injuries.<\/p>",
